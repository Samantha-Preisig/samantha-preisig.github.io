                        <h1>Journey</h1>
                        <p> "Walk the walk" was a quote cycling through my head at the time, just finishing exams for the semester, I had this quote to remind myself to keep walking, keep moving, left, right, left, right. My hand walks the walk as that's how I see myself progressing; through my hands, my creation spills from my head through my hands and onto a universal media that can be translated to communicate and express my academic and creative mindset.</p>

                        <p>This piece was made for my father for Christmas 2020. I touched it up slightly with more background noise as I wasn't satisfied with how unfinished the background was. This was my second piece with photoshop and my first time using blending brushes. Blending digitally vs traditionally is quite a learning curve.</p>

                        <p>This is a design I was playing with for the company, Teddy Fresh. Teddy Fresh is an extremely vibrant, fresh, and unique clothing company. I greatly look up to the CEO, Hila Klein. I'm inspired by her work and her nature. She is quiet with her success but is always working on something new and original. Her perception of art is fantastic and her collaborations with other artists complement her work so well.</p>

                        <p1>I discovered shading by hatching. This allows me to get incredibly detailed, especially in small areas. My intention was to replicate somewhat of a "wanted" sign.</p1>
                        <p2>The "X" marked in 'blood' hits Walter White's head which emphasizes how incredibly important his knowledge in chemistry is. "W.W." was found in Gale's lab notes which almost incriminated Walter. Gale's lab notes are hidden behind his face. The rest of the background is the chemical compound for methamphetamine.</p2>

                        <p>Hila and Ethan Klein (subjects of this piece) are apart of a podcast called "The H3 Podcast" which kept me company during the COVID-19 lockdowns. With the amount of entertainment and energy they put into their podcast, I thought it would be disrespectful not to create an artwork of them to timestamp this period of my life; living through a pandemic and having the pleasure of their company. For context: one of Hila's famous sayings is "waddup big pimp," and Ethan went viral for his "vape nation" video that circulated in 2016. (The artist concept for Hila was heavily referenced by an anonymous artist).</p>
